# 1DOF-helicopter-with-analog-PID
Schematic design of analog PID controller
The 1DOF Helicopter Tail is a mechanism that can only move up or down angularly. In this project, analog PID circuit is used. KP and KD are adjustable and KI parameter is kept constant. The desired angle and feedback signals are also controlled by the op-amp that performs the subtraction.
